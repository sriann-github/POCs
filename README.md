1. [Srivalli Annamraju | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srivalliannamraju/)

I have developed and implemented innovative solutions using Azure technologies, including creating a predictive maintenance system with Azure ML that automates data workflows through Azure Gen AI, and developing a personalized marketing proof of concept to enhance customer engagement. I have integrated the Azure Translator Text service for diverse applications and implemented the Azure Text-to-Speech service to improve accessibility for visually impaired users. My experience includes building an end-to-end application using Azure Form Recognizer for receipt scanning and expense calculations, deploying an Ubuntu VM through Python scripting, and utilizing ChatGPT to refine deployment plans for Apache2 with Terraform. Moreover, I have explored Docker, Node.js, and Redis for application management, developed an ASP.Net web application with Docker, AKS, and Azure Container Registry, and deployed a WordPress site on Azure App Service while configuring a Windows VM with IIS and SQL Database for optimal scalability and resource management. This diverse experience highlights my ability to leverage cloud technologies effectively to meet various business needs.
